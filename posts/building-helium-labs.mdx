I started Helium Labs in summer 2024 with a different approach to building AI companies: instead of betting everything on one product, we're building multiple focused solutions. Here's why.

## AI is moving fast

New models and capabilities emerge weekly, creating opportunities but also challenges:

- Most AI products overwhelm users with complexity
- Enterprise solutions are priced out of reach for small businesses
- Many products solve theoretical rather than practical problems

We believe there's a unique opportunity: building simple, focused AI tools that solve real problems.

## The Holding Company Advantage

Traditional startups follow a linear path: one product, one market, one bet. We believe AI is different - we can build multiple products and learn what works.

A holding company structure gives us three key advantages:

1. **Rapid Testing**: We can launch multiple products quickly and learn what works
2. **Shared Resources**: Our products benefit from cashflow, common technical operations, and shared learnings
3. **Move Fast**: We can pivot resources as opportunities emerge

## Our Initial Products

We've launched two products that showcase our approach:

### PhotoGenius.ai
Most AI image generators are either too basic or overwhelmingly complex. PhotoGenius makes it simple: describe what you want, get professional-quality results.

### NinjaChat.ai
People are juggling multiple AI subscriptions, each with its own interface and cost. NinjaChat combines essential AI tools into one intuitive interface with simple pricing.

## Looking Forward

While we're continuously improving PhotoGenius and NinjaChat, we're also watching the AI landscape closely. Our structure lets us move quickly when we spot opportunities to solve real problems.

We're not chasing vanity metrics or fundraising headlines. Our mission is simple: build useful AI tools that make work easier and more productive.
